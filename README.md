A simple, console-based hurdle game developed in C, where the player controls a dinosaur that jumps over moving obstacles. The game features progressive difficulty, score tracking, and basic gameplay mechanics using ASCII art. It is a fun way to practice programming and game development in C.

Features:
  Dynamic Obstacles: Moving obstacles that the player must jump over.
  Progressive Difficulty: The speed of obstacles increases as the game progresses.
  Jumping Mechanics: The dinosaur can jump over obstacles when the space bar is pressed.
  Score Tracking: The game tracks the score based on how long the player survives.
  Game Over: The game ends if the dinosaur collides with an obstacle.
  Exit Option: The player can exit the game anytime by pressing 'X'.
  
Technologies: 
  C Programming: The game is written in C.
  ASCII Art: The dinosaur and obstacles are represented using ASCII characters.
  Windows Console: The game uses Windows API functions (SetConsoleCursorPosition and GetStdHandle) to control the cursor and display output.
  Game Mechanics: Includes jump height control, collision detection, and obstacle movement.
  
How to Play:
  Run the Program: Compile and run the Dino Game in any C compiler that supports conio.h and Windows-specific functions.
  Control the Dinosaur. 
  Space Bar: Makes the dinosaur jump to avoid obstacles.
  X: Exits the game.
  Goal: Survive as long as possible by jumping over obstacles. Your score increases as you successfully avoid obstacles.
  
How to Run:
  Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dino-game.git
  Open the project in your preferred C compiler or IDE (like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio).
  Compile the dino.c file and run the program.
